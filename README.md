# BP_UPMSTMC
### This repository  for data and experimental results of unrelated parallel machine scheduling with setup times and machine cost 
- test instances: random data for experiments
- 01-experiment_results: experiment results for four versions of branch-and-price algorithms, and models
- 02-experiment_results: experiment results for B&P basd set covering, B&P consisting of dynamic programming without 1-cycle, heuristic pricing, state-of-the-art models, and three-indexed models
- 03-experiment_results: experiment results for dominance relationship between two objectives
- 04-experiment_results: experiment results for instances obeying triangular distributions
- 05-experiment_results: experiment results for models with valid inequalities.
